[00:25.72] The markings on your surface
[00:30.45] Your speckled face
[00:36.95] Flawed crystals hang from your ears
[00:45.68] I couldn't gauge your fears
[00:59.18] 
[00:51.17] I can't relate to my peers
[00:57.56] I'd rather live outside
[01:03.47] I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
[01:10.07] Maybe I'm a fool
[01:18.07] 
[01:15.52] Maybe I should move and settle
[01:19.31] Two kids and a swimming pool
[01:22.75] I'm not brave
[01:29.85] (Brave)
[01:33.38] I'm not brave
[01:39.88] 
[01:42.25] I'm living over city
[01:44.89] And taking in the homeless sometimes, I've
[01:53.42] Been living in an idea
[01:56.18] An idea from another man's mind
[02:11.68] 
[02:03.63] Maybe I'm a fool
[02:05.88] To settle for a place with some nice views (nice views)
[02:12.15] Maybe I should move, settle down
[02:16.03] Two kids and a swimming pool
[02:19.38] I'm not brave
[02:25.88] 
[02:25.27] I'd rather live outside
[02:31.05] I'd rather live outside
[02:34.56] I'd rather go to jail
[02:37.06] I've tried hell (it's a loop)
[02:41.35] What would you recommend I do?
[02:43.06] (The other side of the loop is a loop)
[03:02.06] 
[02:46.62] This, this fe-, this feel, this feel, this feels
[02:49.79] This feels how molly must feel
[02:51.43] This feels how molly must feel
[02:53.05] How molly must feel
[02:54.14] This feels how molly must feel
[02:55.59] How molly must feel
[03:05.09] 
[02:57.33] This is not my life
[02:59.72] It's just a fond farewell to a friend
[03:04.84] It's just a fond farewell to a friend
[03:08.00] This is not my life
[03:10.28] It's just a fond farewell to a friend
[03:13.77] It's not what I'm like
[03:16.92] It's just a fond farewell (brave)
[03:33.42] 
[03:27.53] Speaking of nirvana, it was there
[03:31.02] Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
[03:34.41] There with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping, yeah
[04:02.41] 
[03:39.59] Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
[03:41.41] That could think of the dreamer that thought
[03:43.63] That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
[03:47.77] I be dreaming a dream in a thought
[03:49.75] That could dream about a thought
[03:51.42] That could think of dreaming a dream
[03:52.72] Where I cannot, where I cannot
[04:07.72] 
[04:00.18] Less morose and more present
[04:02.89] Dwell on my gifts for a second
[04:05.10] A moment one solar flare would consume, so why not
[04:10.73] Spin this flammable paper on the film that's my life
[04:14.26] High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
[04:18.16] Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry, about you
[04:22.79] See some colors, light hang glide off the moon
[04:45.79] 
[04:25.12] (In the dark, in the dark)
[04:30.88] I'd do anything for you
[04:35.18] (In the dark)
[04:36.86] I'd do anything for you
[04:40.54] (In the dark)
[04:42.23] I'd do anything for you
[04:46.24] (In the dark)
[04:47.87] I'd do anything for you
[04:51.95] (In the dark)
[04:58.45] 
[04:53.69] I'd do anything for you, anything for you
[04:58.08] (In the dark)
[04:59.53] I'd do anything for you, anything for you
